## About Me
I started my career in nursing, a profession that taught me responsbility, risk management, and working calmly under pressure. 
Over time, I realised I was more drawn to systems, problem-solving, and how technology supports critical services. This led me to transition into technical customer support role and begin my journey to build a solid foundation in computer networking. 

## Why Networking?
Networking is the foundation of all modern IT infrastructure and cybersecurity systems. Through my research and hands-on learning, I've become increasingly interested in understanding how data moves, how systems communicate, and how issues are diagnosed and resolved at the network level. 

Coming from a nursing background, I see a strong parallel: just as understanding human anatomy is essential before accurately diagnosing and treating patients, understanding networking fundamentals is critical before specialising in areas such as cybersecurity. This mindset is what guides my learning apporach. 
Therefore, my goal is to build strong funamentals in networking before progressing into cybersecurity roles and documenting my journey along the way.

  ## Current Role
  Customer Service Technical Advisor at EE, where I:
  - Troubleshoot connectivity issues
  - Communicate technical problems clearly to non-technical users
  - Work in a fast-paced, customer-facing environment

  This role has strengthened my troubleshooting approach and reinforced my interest in networking
  and infrastructure. 

  ## What I'm Currently Learning#
- Cisco networking fundamentals (Packet Tracer Labs)
- IP addressing, subnetting, VLANs, routing, DHCP, DNS and NAT
- Python for basic network automation
- GitHub for documentation and version control

  ## Practical Learning & Projects
  I learn best by doing.
  Therefore, my practical work will include:
  - Building and documenting network labs in Cisco Packet Tracer
  - Writing clear explanations of networking concepts
  - Creating small Python scripts related to networking tasks

  My projects to date:
  - 'packet-tracer-basic-lan
 
  ## Career Goal
  My short-term goal is to move into a Network Support or NOC role.
  My long-term goal is to work in cybersecurity, supported by strong networking foundations.
